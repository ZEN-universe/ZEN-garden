# Energy-Carbon-Optimization-Platform

Optimization model of European energy systems and value chains. It includes the electricity system, hydrogen value chains, and carbon capture, storage and utilization (CCUS) value chains. 
The model builds up on [Calliope](https://www.callio.pe/), a free and open-source (Apache 2.0 licensed) tool that builds general energy system optimization models.
