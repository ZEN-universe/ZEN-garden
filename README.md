Welcome to the ZEN-garden! ZEN-garden is an optimization model of energy systems and value chains. 
It is currently used to model the electricity system, hydrogen value chains, and carbon capture, storage and utilization (CCUS) value chains. 
However, it is designed to be modular and flexible, and can be extended to model other types of energy systems, value chains or other network-based systems. 

ZEN-garden is developed by the [Reliability and Risk Engineering Laboratory](https://www.rre.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich.

## Documentation
Please refer to the documentation of the ZEN-garden framework [on Read-the-Docs](https://zen-garden.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
To get started with ZEN-garden, you can follow the instructions in the [installation guide](https://zen-garden.readthedocs.io/en/latest/files/installation.html).

In the file `documentation/how_to_ZEN-garden.md`, you can find additional information on how to use the framework. 
The `documentation/dataset_creation_tutorial.md` file contains a tutorial on how to create a simple dataset for the framework. 
Additionally, example datasets are available in the `dataset_examples` folder.

More in-depth manuals are available in the [discussions forum](https://github.com/ZEN-universe/ZEN-garden/discussions) of our repo.
