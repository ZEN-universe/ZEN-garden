Welcome to the ZEN-garden! ZEN-garden is an optimization model of energy systems and value chains. 
It is currently used to model the electricity system, hydrogen value chains, and carbon capture, storage and utilization (CCUS) value chains. 
However, it is designed to be modular and flexible, and can be extended to model other types of energy systems, value chains or other network-based systems. 

ZEN-garden is developed by the [Reliability and Risk Engineering Laboratory](https://www.rre.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich.
