## [Unversioned Changes] - 2026-01-05 

### Documentation Changes 📝
- add class diagrams to documentationn. This category is for all changes to the documentation or to docstrings. Documentation changes will not bump the ZEN-garden version. [[🔀 PR #1165](https://github.com/ZEN-universe/ZEN-garden/pull/1165) @csfunke]

### Maintainance Tasks 🧹
- refactor default_config. Chores include any maintainance tasks such updating tests, improving continuous integration workflows, and refactoring code. They do not change the functionality of ZEN-garden from a user perspective and therefore do not lead to a version bump. [[🔀 PR #1165](https://github.com/ZEN-universe/ZEN-garden/pull/1165) @csfunke]

## [v0.1.0] - [v2.8.4]
