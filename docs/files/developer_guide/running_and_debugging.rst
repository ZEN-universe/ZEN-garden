Running and Debugging
############################


This section describes how to run and debug the ZEN-garden module for 
developers. This section requires that ZEN-Garden repository is forked as 
described in (see :ref:`dev_install.dev_install`). When the repository is 
forked, the code from the fork will be used to execute the module whenever 
ZEN-garden is called on the command line or imported in a python script. 

This section assumes the user already has a model which they would like
to run and is familiar with the the general instructions for :ref:`building a 
model <building.building>` and `running a model <running.running>`. 

Run ZEN-garden as a Developer
=============================

For developers, ZEN-garden can be run in the same way as for model users.
Please refer to to the user guide on :ref:`running ZEN-garden <running.running>`
for details.

.. warning::
    When running ZEN-Garden as a developer, always make sure that the python 
    environment is up to date with the current model version. This means that 
    the ZEN-garden environment should be re-installed each time you pull a new 
    version from the repository. Otherwise, dependency changes may result in 
    errors.


Debugging ZEN-garden
====================

This section describes options for debugging ZEN-garden. Debugging is essential 
for developing and testing the model codebase. Unfortunately, debugging 
ZEN-garden is perhaps unintuitive at first. ZEN-garden is typically run from the 
command line while debugging is usually done with an integrated development 
environment (IDE) such as PyCharm or VSCode. 


Debug ZEN-garden using a Python Script
--------------------------------------

The (perhaps easiest) way of debugging ZEN-garden is to write a python script
from which to execute model runs. This method of running ZEN-garden is
described in detail in the :ref:`additional remarks section for 
running model <running.additional_remarks>`. In short, ZEN-garden
can be run from a python script using the following code:

.. code-block:: python

  from zen_garden.__main__ import run_module
  import os

  os.chdir("<path\to\data>")
  run_module(dataset = "<dataset_name>")

Using a IDE, this python code can be run and debugged using the standard debug
functionalities of the IDE. Any breakpoints set within the ZEN-garden module 
will be stopped at when the script is run in debug mode. As described in the
:ref:`additional remarks section for running model <running.additional_remarks>`,
all command line flags for ZEN-garden can be directly added into the 
``run_module`` function of ZEN-garden.


.. _debug.IDE:

Debug using IDE-specific Configurations
---------------------------------------

Alternatively, developers may also debug ZEN-garden using IDE-specific
debug routines and configurations. These configurations are described 
below for two common IDEs: PyCharm and VSCode. In both cases, the user 
must specify special debug settings in the IDE. These settings essentially 
inform the IDE about which command line script (i.e. ``python -m zen_garden``) 
needs to be run whenever debugging. Once set up, the user can debug ZEN-garden by 
clicking on a button in the IDE. The full ZEN-garden module will then be run
in debug mode, regardless of which file is currently open and being edited. The 
main advantage of this method over the previous one is that users no longer need
to flip back and forth between the file they are editing and a script for
running ZEN-garden. 

PyCharm configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To set-up easy running and debugging with the PyCharm IDE you can use the 
configuration setup. This can be found next to the run button. Click on "Edit 
configurations.." to edit or add a configuration.

Add a new configuration by clicking on the "+" button on the top left corner of 
the window. Choose ``Python`` as a type. You can name the configuration however 
you like. The important settings are:

- Change "Script Path" to "Module name" and set it to "zen_garden"
- Set the Python interpreter to the ZEN-garden anaconda environment. Per 
  default, the environment will be called ``zen-garden-env``. **Important**: 
  This setup will only work for Conda environments that were also declared as 
  such in PyCharm; to set the path to the Python executable, you will have to 
  create a new PyCharm   interpreter first.
- Set the "Working directory" to the path that contains the ``config.json``. 
  This directory will also be used to save the results.

In the end, your configuration to run ZEN-garden as a module should look similar 
to this:

    :alt: run module

Once these configurations are set, the standard ``run`` and ``debug`` buttons of 
the PyCharm IDE can be used. When pressed, these buttons will create and execute 
the appropriate terminal commands for running and debugging ZEN-Garden, 
respectively. Command line flags can be typed into the ``Script Parameters`` 
field of the Run/Debug configurations.


VS code configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To debug ZEN-garden with VSCode, follow these steps:

- select the correct interpreter: Press ctrl + shift + p to open the command 
  palette (if you're on Windows or Linux), and enter 
  ``Python: Select interpreter`` and make sure that the correct conda environment 
  is selected. Per default, the conda environment will be called 
  ``zen-garden-env``.
- Create a new file in the folder ``./.vscode/`` called ``launch.json`` with the 
  following content:

  .. code-block:: JSON

      {   
          "version": "0.2.0",
          "configurations": [
          {
            "name": "Python: ZEN-Garden",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "cwd":"<path to folder with dataset>",
            "request": "launch", "module": "zen_garden",
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
          }
        ]
      }


To debug ZEN-Garden, select ``Python Debugger: Debug using launch.json`` from 
the debug menu as shown in the figure. Note that no command line flags can be 
entered. The dataset must therefore be specified in the config.json file which 
is located in the dataset folder.
