Installation for Developers

If you want to work on the codebase, you can fork and clone the repository from `GitHub <https://github.com/ZEN-universe/ZEN-garden>`_.

If it's your first time using GitHub, register at `<https://github.com/>`_. After you have created an account, you can fork and clone the repository.

Navigate to `<https://github.com/ZEN-universe/ZEN-garden>`_ on Github and click on the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the page to create a copy of the repository under your account and select yourself as the owner.

**Clone your forked repository:**

Clone your forked repository by running the following lines in `Git-Bash <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_::

    git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/ZEN-garden.git
    cd ZEN-garden

Substitute ``<your-username>`` with your Github username. If you gave the forked repository a different name, replace ``ZEN-garden`` with the name of your repository.

.. note::
    If you get the permissions error "Permission denied (publickey)", you will need to create the SSH key. Follow the instructions on `how to generate an SSH key <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key>`_ and then `how to add it to your account <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-account>`_. You will not need to add the SSH key to the Agent, so only follow the first website until before `Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent>`_

**Track the upstream repository:**

Track the upstream repository by running the following lines in Git-Bash::

    git remote add upstream git@github.com:ZEN-universe/ZEN-garden.git
    git fetch upstream

**Create the ZEN-garden conda environment:**

Open the Anaconda prompt. Change the directory to the root directory of your local ZEN-garden repository where the file ``zen_garden_env.yml`` is located::

  cd <path_to_zen_garden_repo>

Now you can install the conda environment for zen-garden with the following command::

  conda env create -f zen_garden_env.yml

The installation may take a couple of minutes. If the installation was successful, you can see the environment at ``C:\Users\<username>\anaconda3\envs`` or wherever Anaconda is installed.

.. note::
    We strongly recommend working with conda environments. When installing the zen-garden conda environment via the ``zen_garden_env.yml``, the zen-garden package, as well as all other dependencies, are installed automatically.
