################
Input data structure
################
The input data is structured in a folder hierarchy. The root folder ``<data_folder>`` contains a subfolder for each dataset and a configuration file ``config.json``.
ZEN-garden is run from this root folder (:ref:`Running a model`). The dataset folder ``<dataset>`` comprises the input data for a specific dataset and must contain the following files and subfolders:

.. code-block::

    <data_folder>/
    |--<dataset>/
    |   |--energy_system/
    |   |   |--attributes.json
    |   |   |--base_units.csv
    |   |   |--set_nodes.csv
    |   |   `--set_edges.csv
    |   |
    |   |--set_carriers/
    |   |   |--<carrier1>/
    |   |   |   `--attributes.json
    |   |   `--<carrier2>/
    |   |       `--attributes.json
    |   |
    |   |--set_technologies/
    |   |   |--set_conversion_technologies/
    |   |   |   |--<conversion_technology1>/
    |   |   |   |   `--attributes.json
    |   |   |   |
    |   |   |   `--<conversion_technology2>/
    |   |   |       `--attributes.json
    |   |   |
    |   |   |--set_storage_technologies/
    |   |   |      `--<storage_technology1>/
    |   |   |          `--attributes.json
    |   |   |
    |   |   `--set_transport_technologies/
    |   |       `--<transport_technology1>/
    |   |           `--attributes.json
    |   |
    |   `--system.json
    |
    `--config.json

Note that all folder names in ``<>`` in the structure above can be chosen freely. The dataset is described by the properties of the ``energy_system``, the ``set_carriers``, and the ``set_technologies``.
The system configuration is stored in the file ``system.json`` and defines dataset-specific settings, e.g., which technologies to model or how many years and time steps to include.
The configuration file ``config.json`` contains more general settings for the optimization problem and the solver. Refer to the section :ref:`System, analysis, solver settings` for more details.

Depending on your analysis, more files can be added; see :ref:`Attribute.json files` and :ref:`Scenario analysis` for more information.

.. _Energy System:
Energy System
==============

The folder ``energy_system`` contains four necessary files: ``attributes.json``, ``base_units.csv``, ``set_nodes.csv``, and ``set_edges.csv``.
The file ``attributes.json`` defines the numerical setup of the energy system, e.g., the carbon emission limits, the discount rate, or the carbon price.
``set_nodes.csv`` and ``set_edges.csv`` define the nodes and edges of the energy system graph, respectively.
``set_nodes.csv`` contains the coordinates of the nodes, which are used to calculate the default distance of the edges.

There is no predefined convention for naming nodes and edges, so the user can choose the naming freely.
In the examples, we use ``<node1>-<node2>`` to name edges, but note that you are not forced to follow that convention.
In fact, ``set_edges.csv`` defines the edges by the nodes they connect.

.. note::
    You can specify more nodes in ``set_nodes.csv`` than you end up using. In ``system.json`` you can define a subset of nodes you want to select in the model. If you do not specify any nodes in ``system.json``, all nodes from ``set_nodes.csv`` are used.

``base_units.csv`` define the base units in the model. That means that all units in the model are converted to a combination of base units.
See :ref:`Unit consistency` for more information.

.. _Technologies:
Technologies
==============
The ``set_technologies`` folder is specified in three subfolders: ``set_conversion_technologies``, ``set_storage_technologies``, and ``set_transport_technologies``.
Each technology has its own folder in the respective subfolder and must contain the ``attributes.json`` file. Additional files can further parametrize the technologies (see :ref:`Attribute.json files`).

.. note::
    You can specify more technologies in the three subfolders than you end up using. That can be helpful if you want to model different scenarios with different technologies and carriers.

Each technology has a reference carrier, i.e., that carrier by which the capacity of the technology is rated.
As an example, a :math:`10kW` heat pump could refer to :math:`10kW_{th}` heat output or :math:`10kW_{el}` electricity input.
Hence, the user has to specify which carrier is the reference carrier in the file ``attributes.json``.
For storage technologies and transport technologies, the reference carrier is the carrier that is stored or transported, respectively.

.. _Conversion Technologies:
Conversion Technologies
-----------------------

The conversion technologies are defined in the folder ``set_conversion_technologies``.
A conversion technology converts ``0`` to ``n`` input carriers into ``0`` to ``m`` output carriers.
Note that the conversion factor between the carriers is fixed, e.g., a combined heat and power (CHP) plant cannot sometimes generate more heat and sometimes generate more electricity.
The file ``attributes.json`` defines the properties of the conversion technology, e.g., the capacity limit, the maximum load, the conversion factor, or the investment cost (see :ref:`conversion_technology`).

A special case of the conversion technologies are retrofitting technologies. These technologies are defined in the folder ``set_conversion_technologies\set_retrofitting_technologies``, if any exist.
They behave equal to conversion technologies, but they are always connected to a conversion technology. They are coupled to a conversion technology by the attribute ``retrofit_flow_coupling_factor`` in the file ``attributes.json``, which couples the reference carrier flow of the retrofitting technology and the base technology.
A possible application of retrofitting technologies is the installation of a carbon-capture unit on top of a power plant. In this case, the base technology would be ``power_plant`` and the retrofitting technology would be ``carbon_capture``. Refer to the dataset example XXXX for more information.

.. _Storage Technologies:
Storage Technologies
--------------------
The storage technologies are defined in the folder ``set_storage_technologies``.
A storage technology connects two time steps by charging at ``t=t0`` and discharging at ``t=t1``.

.. note::
    In ZEN-garden, the power-rated (charging-discharging) capacity and energy-rated (storage level) capacity of storage technologies are optimized independently.
    If you want to fix the energy-to-power ratio, the attribute ``energy_to_power_ratio`` in ``attributes.json`` can be set to anything different than ``inf``.

Transport Technologies
----------------------

The transport technologies are defined in the folder ``set_transport_technologies``.
A transport technology connects two nodes via an edge. Different to conversion technologies or storage technologies, transport technology capacities are built on the edges, not the nodes.

.. note::
    By default, the distance of an edge will be calculated as the `haversine distance <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/haversine-formula-to-find-distance-between-two-points-on-a-sphere/>`_ between the nodes. This can be overwritten for specific edges in a ``distance.csv`` file (see :ref:`Attribute.json files`).

.. _Carriers:
Carriers
==============
Each energy carrier is defined in its own folder in ``set_carriers``. You do not need to specify the used energy carriers explicitly in ``system.json``, but the carriers are implied from the used technologies.
All input, output, and reference carriers that are used in the selected technologies (see `Technologies`_) must be defined in the ``set_carriers`` folder.
The file ``attributes.json`` defines the properties of the carrier, e.g., the carbon intensity or the cost of the carrier.
Additional files can further parametrize the carriers (see :ref:`Attribute.json files`).

.. note::
    You can specify more carriers in ``set_carriers`` than you end up using. That can be helpful if you want to model different scenarios with different technologies and carriers.
