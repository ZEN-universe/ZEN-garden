Key;Type;Default Value;Description
``set_conversion_technologies``;``list[str]``;``[]``;list of conversion technologies included in the optimization
``set_storage_technologies``;``list[str]``;``[]``;list of storage technologies included in the optimization
``set_retrofitting_technologies``;``list[str]``;``[]``;list of retrofitting technologies included in the optimization
``set_transport_technologies``;``list[str]``;``[]``;list of transport technologies included in the optimization
``set_transport_technologies_loss_exponential``;``list[str]``;``[]``;list of transport technologies included in the optimization for which to use an exponential loss factor
``use_capacities_existing``;``bool``;``True``;per default a brownfield optimization is conducted, by setting this parameter to ``False`` existing technology capacities are ignored and a greenfield optimization is conducted
``double_capex_transport``;``bool``;``False``;per default the capex for transport is not separated into the capacity- and the distance-dependent term, as this introduces binary variables
``set_nodes``;``list[str]``;``[]``;per default all nodes are selected, however, by overwriting the empty list value you can conduct the optimization for a subset of subset of nodes
``unaggregated_time_steps_per_year``;``int``;``8760``;per default the total hours per year are set to 8760, overwrite this parameter if you want to investigate a shorter period
``conduct_time_series_aggregation``;``bool``;``False``;per default the time-series-aggregation is not conducted, set to ``True`` to enable the timeseries aggregation
``total_hours_per_year``;``int``;``8760``;defines the definition of a year. Do not change this value unless you know what you are doing
``aggregated_time_steps_per_year``;``int``;``10``;per default the timeseries aggregation aggregates the number of time-steps to 10, overwrite this value to increase or decrease the intra-yearly temporal resolution
``reference_year``;``int``;``2024``;per default the reference year is set to 2024
``optimized_years``;``int``;``1``;per default, the optimization is conducted for 1 year, change this value to investigate longer time horizons
``interval_between_years``;``int``;``1``;per default, the optimization is conducted for each year, change this value to only investigate every second (2) year or every third (3) year, etc.
``use_rolling_horizon``;``bool``;``False``;per default the optimization is conducted assuming perfect foresight, set this parameter to ``True`` if you want to use a rolling horizon approach with myopic foresight instead
``years_in_rolling_horizon``;``int``;``1``;per default the foresight is limited of the rolling horizon approach is limited to one year, flexibly increase or decrease this value to investigate longer or shorter foresight horizons
``years_in_decision_horizon``;``int``;``1``;per default, the rolling horizon decision horizon is one year, increase this value to only allow decision every second (2) or third (3) planning period, etc.
``conduct_scenario_analysis``;``bool``;``False``;per default only the optimization is only conducted for the default scenario, set to ``True`` to conduct scenario analysis
``run_default_scenario``;``bool``;``True``;per default the optimization is conducted for the default scenario as well as all scenarios specified in ``scenarios.json`` , if ``False`` the optimization is only conducted for the scenarios specified in ``scenarios.json``
``clean_sub_scenarios``;``bool``;``False``;per default sub-scenarios are not removed, set to ``True`` to delete sub-scenarios between runs
``set_transport_technologies_loss_exponential``;``list[str]``;``[]``;list of transport technologies for which exponential transport loss function is used
``double_capex_transport``;``bool``;``False``;per default only distance dependent capital expenditures are applied to transport tech, if true, apply both fix capital expenditures (capex) and distance dependent capex to installation of transport technologies
``storage_periodicity``;``bool``;``True``;enable storage periodicity
``exclude_parameters_from_TSA``;``bool``;``True``;exclude selected parameters from the timeseries aggregation
``knowledge_depreciation_rate``;``float``;``0.1``;knowledge deprecation rate to be used in the technology expansion constraint
