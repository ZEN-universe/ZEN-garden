Input data handling
################

.. _Attribute.json files:
Attribute.json files
==============
Each element in the input data folder has an ``attributes.json`` file, as shown in :ref:`Input data structure`, which defines the default values for the element.
This file must be specified for each element and must contain all parameters that this class of elements (Technology, Carrier, etc.) can have (see :ref:`Sets, parameters, variables, and constraints`).

The ``attributes.json`` files have three main purposes:

1. Defining all parameters of each element
2. Providing the default value for each parameter
3. Defining the unit of each parameter

How are ``attributes.json`` files structured?
---------------------------------------------
The general structure of each ``attributes.json`` file is the following:

.. code-block::

    {
      "parameter_1": {
        "default_value": v_1,
        "unit": "u_1"
      },
      "parameter_2": {
        "default_value": v_2,
        "unit": "u_2"
      },
      ...
    }

The structure is a normal dictionary structure.
Make sure to have the correct positioning of the brackets.

* There is **one curly** bracket around all parameters ``{...}``
* Each parameter has a name, followed **by a colon and curly brackets** ``name: {...}``
* Inside the curly brackets are in most cases a ``default_value`` as a ``float`` or ``"inf"`` and a ``unit`` as a ``string`` (see :ref:`Unit consistency`).

What are particular parameters in the ``attributes.json`` file?
-------------------------------------------------------------
Some parameters do not have the structure above. These are the carriers of technologies (``"reference_carrier"``, ``"input_carrier"``, and ``"output_carrier"``), the ``"conversion_factor"`` of conversion technologies, and the ``"retrofit_flow_coupling_factor"`` of retrofitting technologies.

**Input, output, and reference carriers**

.. code-block::

    "output_carrier": {
      "default_value": [
        "heat",
        "electricity"
      ],
    }

The default value of the three carrier types are a list ``[..., ...]``. It can take the following lengths:

1. 1 carrier: Necessary in the case of the reference carrier
2. 0 carrier: Empty list if no input or output carrier
3. more than 1 carrier: for multiple input or output carriers

The units of the carriers in a technology are defined in the corresponding parameters (see :ref:`Unit consistency`) and are therefore omitted in the ``"reference_carrier"``, ``"input_carrier"``, and ``"output_carrier"`` field.

**Conversion factor**

The ``conversion_factor`` is the fixed ratio between a carrier flow and the reference carrier flow, defined for all dependent carriers, i.e., all carriers except the reference carrier.

.. code-block::

    dependent_carriers = input_carriers + output_carriers - reference_carrier

ZEN-garden will check i) that the reference carrier is not part of the input and output carriers, ii) that there is no overlap between the input and output carriers, and iii) that all carriers are defined in their respective folders in ``set_carriers``.
The default conversion factor is defined in ``attributes.json`` as:

.. code-block::

    "conversion_factor": [
      {
        "heat": {
          "default_value": 1.257,
          "unit": "GWh/GWh"
        }
      },
      {
        "natural_gas": {
          "default_value": 2.857,
          "unit": "GWh/GWh"
        }
      }
    ]
The conversion factor is **a list ``[...]`` with each dependent carrier wrapped in curly brackets**. Inside each curly bracket, there are the ``default_value`` and the ``unit``.

**Retrofitting flow coupling factor**

The retrofitting flow coupling factor couples the reference carrier flow of the retrofitting technology and the base technology (:ref:`Conversion Technologies`). The default value is defined in ``attributes.json`` as:

.. code-block::

    "retrofit_flow_coupling_factor": {
      "base_technology": <base_technology_name>,
      "default_value": 0.5,
      "unit": "GWh/GWh"
    }

The retrofitting flow coupling factor is a single parameter with the base technology as a string and the default value and unit as usual.

.. _Overwriting default values:
Overwriting default values
==========================
The paradigm of ZEN-garden is that the user only has to specify those input data that they want to specify.
Therefore, the user defines default values for all parameters in the ``attributes.json`` files.
Whenever more information is required, the user can overwrite the default values by providing a ``<parameter_name>.csv`` file in the same folder as the ``attributes.json`` file.

Let's assume the following example: The purpose of the energy system is to provide ``heat``, whose default ``demand`` is given as ``10 GW``:

.. code-block::

    {
      "demand": {
        "default_value": 10,
        "unit": "GW"
      }
    }

The energy system is modeled for two nodes, ``CH`` and ``DE`` and spans one year with 8760 time steps.

.. note::
    To retrieve the dimensions of a parameter, please refer to :ref:`optimization_problem` and to the ``index_names`` attribute in the parameter definition.

Providing extra .csv files
--------------------------
If the user wants to specify the demand ``CH`` and ``DE`` in the time steps ``0, 14, 300``, the user can create a file ``demand.csv``:

.. code-block::

    node,time,demand
    CH,0,5
    CH,14,7
    CH,300,3
    DE,0,2
    DE,14,3
    DE,300,2

The file overwrites the default value for the demand at nodes ``CH`` and ``DE`` in time steps ``0, 14,300``.

.. note::
    ZEN-garden will select that subset of data that is relevant for the optimization problem.
    If the user specifies a demand for a node in ``demand.csv`` that is not part of the optimization problem, the demand is ignored for this node.

To avoid overly long files, the dimensions can be unstacked, i.e., the values of one dimension can be the column names of the file:

.. code-block::

    node,0,14,300
    CH,5,7,3
    DE,2,3,2

or

.. code-block::

    time,CH,DE
    0,5,2
    14,7,3
    300,3,2

Therefore, the full demand time series is ``10 GW`` except for the time steps ``0, 14, 300`` where it is ``5 GW, 7 GW, 3 GW`` for ``CH`` and ``2 GW, 3 GW, 2 GW`` for ``DE``.

.. warning::
    Make sure that the unit of the values in the ``.csv`` file is consistent with the unit defined in the ``attributes.json`` file!
    Since we do not specify a unit in the ``.csv`` file, the unit of the values is assumed to be the same as the unit in the ``attributes.json`` file.

Constant dimensions
-------------------
Often, we have parameters that are constant over a certain dimension but change with another dimension.
For example, the demand of an industrial energy carrier might be constant over time but is different for all nodes.

In this case, the full ``demand.csv`` file would be:

.. code-block::

    node,0,1,2,...,8760
    CH,5,5,5,...,5
    DE,2,2,2,...,2

This is a very long file, and it is hard to see the structure of the data. Furthermore, it is prone to errors. Therefore, ZEN-garden allows you to drop dimensions that are constant. The file can be shortened to:

.. code-block::

    node,demand
    CH,5
    DE,2

The file is much shorter and easier to read. ZEN-garden will automatically fill in the missing dimensions with the constant value.

.. _Yearly variation:
Yearly variation
----------------
We specify hourly-dependent data for each hour of the year.
However, some parameters might have a yearly variation, e.g., the overall demand may increase or decrease over the year.

To this end, the user can specify a file ``<parameter_name>_yearly_variation.csv`` that multiplies the hourly-dependent data with a factor for each hour of the year.
ZEN-garden therefore assumes the same time series for each year but allows for the scaling of the time series with the yearly variation.
Per default, the yearly variation is assumed to be ``1``. Therefore, for missing values in ``<parameter_name>_yearly_variation.csv``, the hourly-dependent data is not scaled.

The user can specify the yearly variation for all dimensions except for the ``time`` dimension:

.. code-block::

    node,2020,2021,2022,...,2050
    CH,1,1.1,1.2,...,4
    DE,1,0.99,0.98,...,0.7

If all nodes have the same yearly variation, the file can be shortened to:

.. code-block::

    year,demand_yearly_variation
    2020,1
    2021,1.1
    2022,1.2
    ...
    2050,4

.. note::
    So far, ZEN-garden does not allow for different time series for each year but only for the scaling while keeping the same shape of the time series.

Data interpolation
-------------
To reduce the number of data points, ZEN-garden per-default interpolates the data points linearly between the given data points.
As an example, in :ref:`Yearly variation`, the demand increase or decrease is linear over the years.
So, the user can reduce the number of data points in the ``demand_yearly_variation.csv`` file:

.. code-block::

    year,demand_yearly_variation
    2020,1
    2050,4

If the user wants to disable the interpolation for a specific parameter, the user can create a ``parameters_interpolation_off.json`` file and specify the parameter names in the file:

.. code-block::

    {
      "parameter_name": [
        "carbon_emissions_annual_limit",
        "demand_yearly_variation"
      ]
    }

.. note::
    The user must specify the file name, i.e., in the example above, the specified file is ``demand_yearly_variation.csv``, not ``demand.csv``.
    Therefore, the interpolation is only disabled for the yearly variation, not for the hourly-dependent data.

.. _PWA:
Piece-wise affine input data
----------------------------
In ZEN-garden, we can model the capital expenditure (CAPEX) of conversion technologies either linear or piece-wise affine (PWA).
In the linear case, the ``capex_specific_conversion`` parameter is treated like every other parameter, i.e., the user can specify a constant value and a ``.csv`` file.

In the PWA case, the user can specify a ``nonlinear_capex.csv`` file that contains the breakpoints and the CAPEX values of the PWA representation.
A PWA representation is a set of linear functions that are connected at the breakpoints. The breakpoints are the capacity additions :math:`\Delta S_m` with the corresponding CAPEX values :math:`\alpha_m`.

.. image:: ../images/PWA.png
    :alt: Piece-wise affine representation of CAPEX

The file ``nonlinear_capex.csv`` has the following structure:

.. code-block::

    capacity_addition,capex_specific_conversion
    0,2000
    20,1700
    40,1500
    60,1350
    80,1200
    100,1100
    120,1010
    140,940
    160,890
    180,860
    200,840
    GW,Euro/kW

.. note::

    Each new interval between two breakpoints adds a binary variable to the optimization problem, for each technology, each year, and each node. The binary variable is 1 if the capacity is in the interval and 0 otherwise.
    The user is advised to keep the number of breakpoints low to avoid a combinatorial explosion of binary variables.

.. _Unit consistency:
Unit consistency
================
Our models describe physical processes, whose numeric values are always connected to a physical unit. For example, the capacity of a coal power plant is a power, thus the unit is, e.g., GW.
In our optimization models, we use a large variety of different technologies and carriers, for which the input data is often provided in different units. The optimization problem itself however only accepts numeric values.

Thus, we have to make sure that the numeric values have the same physical base unit, i.e., if our input data for technology A is in GW and for technology B in MW, we want to convert both numeric values to, e.g., GW.
Another reason for using a base unit is to `keep the numerics of the optimization model in check <https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.5/refman/guidelines_for_numerical_i.html>`_.

Convert units to common base units
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We define a set of base units, which we can combine to represent each dimensionality in our model. Each unit has a certain physical dimensionality:

.. code-block::

    km => [distance]
    hour => [time]
    Euro => [currency]
    GW => [mass]^1 [length]^2 [time]^-3
We make use of the fact, that we can combine the base units to any unit by comparing the dimensionalities. For example, Euro/MWh can be converted to:

.. code-block::

    Euro/MWh
    => [currency]^1 [mass]^-1 [length]-2 [time]^2
    = [currency]^1 [[mass]^1 [length]^2 [time]^-3]^-1 [time]^-1
    => Euro/GW/hour

We convert the units by calculating the multiplier

.. code-block::

    (Euro/GW/hour)/(Euro/MWh) = (MW)/(GW) = 0.001

and multiplying the numeric value with the multiplier.

The base units are defined in the input data set in the file ``/energy_system/base_units.csv``.
You have to provide an input unit for all attributes in the input files. The unit is added as the ``unit`` field after the default value in the ``attributes.json`` file (:ref:`Attribute.json files`).

Defining new units
------------------

We are using the package `pint <https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, which already has the most common units defined. However, some exotic ones, such as ``Euro``, are not yet defined. You can add new units in the file ``system_specification/unit_definitions.txt``:

.. code-block::

    Euro = [currency] = EURO = Eur
    pkm = [mileage] = passenger_km = passenger_kilometer

Here, we make use of the existing dimensionality ``[currency]``. If there is a unit you want to define with a dimensionality that does not exist yet, you can define it the same way:
``pkm = [mileage]``.
The unit ``pkm`` now has the dimensionality ``[mileage]``.

**What do I have to look out for?**

There are a few rules to follow in choosing the base units:

1. The base units must be exhaustive, thus all input units must be represented as a combination of the base units (i.e., ``Euro/MWh => Euro/GW/hour``). Each base unit can only be raised to the power 1, -1, or 0. We do not want to represent a unit by any base unit with a different exponent, e.g., ``km => (m^3)^(1/3)``
2. The base units themselves can not be linearly dependent, e.g., you cannot choose the base units ``GW``, ``hour`` and ``GJ``.
3. The dimensionalities must be unique. While you can use ``m^3`` and ``km``, you cannot use both ``MW`` and ``GW``. You will get a warning if you define the same unit twice.

Enforcing unit consistency
--------------------------

Converting all numeric values to the same set of base units enforces that all magnitudes are comparable; however, this does not ensure that the units are consistent across parameters and elements (technologies and carriers).
For example, a user might have defined the capacity of an electrolyzer in ``GW``, but the investment costs in ``Euro/(ton/hour)``.

To enforce unit consistency, ZEN-garden checks the units of all parameters and elements and throws an error if the units are not consistent.
In particular, ZEN-garden connects technologies to their reference carriers and checks if the units of the reference carriers are consistent with the units of the technology parameters.
If any inconsistency is found, ZEN-garden tries to guess the inconsistent unit (the least common unit) and displays it in the error message.

After ensuring unit consistency, ZEN-garden implies the units of all variables in the optimization problem based on the units of the parameters.
Each variable definition (``variable.add_variable()``) has the argument ``unit_category`` that defines the combination of units and can look like ``unit_category={"energy_quantity": 1, "time": -1}``.

.. note::

    In the results (:ref:`Accessing results`), you can retrieve the unit of all parameters and variables by calling ``r.get_unit(<variable/parameter name>)``, where ``r`` is a results object.

Known issues with pint
--------------------------------

The ``pint`` package that we use for the unit handling has amazing functionalities but also some hurdles to look out for. The ones we have already found are:

* ``ton``: pint uses the keyword ``ton`` for imperial ton, not the metric ton. The keyword for those are ``metric_ton`` or ``tonne``. However, per default, ZEN-garden overwrites the definition of ``ton`` to be the metric ton, so ``ton`` and ``tonne`` can be used interchangeably.
If you for some reason want to use imperial tons, set ``"solver": {"define_ton_as_metric_ton": false}``.
* ``h``: Until recently, ``h`` was treated as the planck constant, not hour. Fortunately, this has been fixed in Feb 2023. If you encounter this error, please update your pint version.

.. _Scaling:
Scaling
=============

What is scaling and when to use it?
-----------------------------------
Simply put, with scaling we aim at enhancing the numeric properties of a given optimization problem, such that solvers can solve it more efficiently and faster. It is generally recommended to include scaling, if the optimization problem at hand faces numerical issues or requires a long time to solve.

Scaling is done by transforming the coefficients of the decision variables in both constraints and objective function to a similar order of magnitude.
In more mathematical terms, consider an optimization problem of the form:

.. math::

    \text{minimize} \quad & c^T x \\
    \text{subject to} \quad & Ax \leq b \\

Where :math:`x \in \mathbb{R}^n` is the vector of decision variables, :math:`A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}` is the constraint matrix, :math:`b \in \mathbb{R}^m` is the right-hand side vector and :math:`c \in \mathbb{R}^n` is the cost vector. Note, that in ZEN-garden the constraints and optimization problem formulation can be generally of any form, however, for simpler notation we consider here the above form.
If we now choose appropriate positive values for the column scaling vector :math:`s = [s_1, s_2, ..., s_n]` and row scaling vector :math:`r = [r_1, r_2, ..., r_m]`, we can scale the optimization problem with the two diagonal matrices :math:`S = diag(s)` and :math:`R = diag(r)`, such that the scaled optimization problem is:

.. math::

    \text{minimize} \quad & c^T S x \\
    \text{subject to} \quad & R A S x \leq R b

If done successfully the scaled optimization problem has beneficial numeric properties such that it is less computational expensive to solve
compared to the original formulation. Note that the objective value remains the same and that the problem's solution is rescaled automatically
within ZEN-garden so that also the decision variables are in the original scale.

Scaling Algorithms
------------------
In ZEN-garden we provide 3 different scaling algorithms, from which the row and column scaling vector entries are determined:

1. (Approximated) Geometric Mean (``"geom"``)
2. Arithmetic Mean (``"arithm"``)
3. Infinity Norm (``"infnorm"``)

The approximated geometric mean is the root of the product of the maximum and minimum absolute values of the respective row or column.
The arithmetic mean is derived over all absolute values of the respective row or column.
The infinity norm is the maximum absolute value of the respective row or column.
For a more detailed explanation of each algorithm please see the paper from `Elble and Sahinidis (2012) <https://rdcu.be/dStfc>`_.

**Combination of Scaling Algorithms**

While the scaling algorithms can be used individually,
they can also be combined. In this case, over multiple iterations you can apply a sequence of different scaling algorithms. See :ref:`How to use scaling in ZEN-garden` for more information.

**Right-Hand Side Scaling**

Furthermore, for all of the above mentioned algorithms, also the right-hand side vector :math:`b` can be included in the scaling process.
If included, the chosen algorithm determines the row scaling vector entry for a specific row :math:`i` over all entries of that row in the constraint matrix :math:`A_{i*}` while also considering the respective right-hand side entry :math:`b_i`.

.. _How to use scaling in ZEN-garden:
How to use scaling in ZEN-garden?
---------------------------------
As described in, :ref:`Configurations` in the :ref:`Solver` section, scaling can be activated by adjusting the
``analysis.json`` file. The scaling configuration can be chosen through the following three settings:

1. ``use_scaling``: Boolean, whether scaling should be used or not.
2. ``scaling_algorithm``: List of strings, the scaling algorithms to be used. Possible entries are: ``"geom"``, ``"arithm"``, ``"infnorm"``. The length of the list determines the number of iterations.
3. ``include_rhs``: Boolean, whether the right-hand side vector should be included for determining the row scaling vector or not.

For example, the following configuration would use a combination of two iterations of the geometric mean scaling followed by one iteration of the infinity norm algorithm as well as taking into account the right-hand side vector:

.. code-block::

  "solver": {
    "use_scaling": true,
    "scaling_algorithm": ["geom", "geom","infnorm"],
    "scaling_include_rhs": true
  }

The default configuration are three iterations of the geometric mean scaling algorithm with right-hand-side scaling.

Recommendations for using scaling
-------------------------------
Here are some recommendations on what configuration to use and when and when not to use scaling. These rules were derived from the results of benchmarking the scaling procedure on different optimization problems as shown :ref:`Results of benchmarking`.
Please note that these recommendations are general and are likely to not apply to all optimization problems. They rather serve as a starting configuration
which then can be adjusted based on the problem at hand via for example trial and error.

**Which algorithm to choose and how many iterations?**

The benchmarking indicated a convergence of the numerical range of the scaled optimization problem
mostly after the third iteration. Therefore, it is recommended to use at least three iterations of the scaling algorithm.
The geometric mean scaling algorithm and the combination of geometric mean followed by infinity norm scaling showed the
overall best performance across the considered optimization problems. Therefore, it is recommended to use one of the following configurations:

* ``scaling_algorithm``: ``["geom", "geom", "geom"]``
* ``scaling_algorithm``: ``["geom", "geom", "infnorm"]``

**When to include the right-hand side vector?**

The benchmarking showed that including the right-hand side vector in the scaling process leads to a better performance of the solver for almost all optimization problems considered.
Therefore, it is recommended to include the right-hand side vector in the scaling process by setting ``scaling_include_rhs``: ``True``.

**When not to use scaling?**

If the optimization problem already has a good numerical range (which can be checked with ``"solver": {"analyze_numerics": true}``), scaling might not be necessary. Also if the optimization problem already solves fast, the time necessary for scaling the problem might
outweigh the time savings from solving the scaled optimization problem. As a rule of thumb, if the time to solve the optimization problem is in similar order of magnitude as the time to scale the problem, scaling should not be applied. The time necessary for scaling can be checked in the output of the optimization problem, if
scaling is applied.

**How to deal with other complementary solver settings?**

Some solvers might also have their own scaling algorithms or other algorithms to improve the numerical properties of the optimization problem. In our benchmarking, we examined the interaction of the respective functionalities of Gurobi and scaling in ZEN-garden.
Gurobi has the two options ``ScaleFlag`` and ``NumericFocus`` that aim at improving numerical properties. The following recommendations can be given based on the results of the benchmarking:

* ``NumericFocus`` should be set to its default value ``0``.
* ``ScaleFlag`` should be set to ``0`` (off) as the scaling in ZEN-garden already takes care of scaling the optimization problem and scaling the problem twice led on average to longer solving times. However, this varied across the optimization problems and therefore this again serves more as a default value to start with and should be tested for the specific problem at hand.

For similar functionalities in other solvers, it is recommended to test the interaction of the respective functionalities with the scaling in ZEN-garden via trial and error.

Results of benchmarking
-----------------------
The scaling functionality was benchmarked by running the following set of models with various scaling configurations:

.. csv-table:: Models used for benchmarking
    :header-rows: 1
    :file: tables/benchmarking_model.csv
    :widths: 10 20 10 10 10 10
    :delim: ;

Overall, for the purpose of benchmarking over all models a total number of 3250 runs were collected.
The following sections will display the results of the benchmarking analysis and should provide insights about the effectiveness and functionality of the scaling algorithm.

**Numerical Range vs. Number of Iterations**

As argued in :ref:`Recommendations for using scaling` the numerical range showed convergence
in most cases after just three iterations. The following results of running the scaling algorithms geometric mean (``geom``) and arithmetic mean (``arithm``)
for the model ``PI_small`` for different number of iterations, portrays this result:

.. image:: images/PI_small.png
    :alt: Numerical range vs. number of scaling iterations

The dots indicate the left-hand side (LHS) range, which corresponds to the range of the A-matrix :math:`A`, whereas the crosses represent
the numerical range of the right-hand side (RHS) vector :math:`b`. Light colors indicate the respective scaling configurations that exclude the right-hand side
in the derivation of the row scaling vector.

From the plot we can observe:

* convergence of the numerical range (of the LHS) is visible for both algorithms after three iterations
* a trade-off between a lower LHS range and also decreasing the RHS range may exist, which is visible in case of arithmetic mean scaling
* neglecting the RHS may lead to a significant increase in its numerical range, which is visible for both scaling algorithms (as shown in :ref:`regression_analysis` this also leads on average to longer solving times)

Net-solving time comparison for multiple scaling configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following plots show the net-solving time (solving time + scaling time) for the models ``PI_small`` and ``NoErr``. These models were chosen as they represent very different results in terms
of effectiveness of scaling. The model ``PI_small`` showed mostly a significant decrease in net-solving time when scaling was applied, whereas the model ``NoErr`` showed no significant effect of scaling on the net-solving time or even worse an
increase in solving-time.

Note, that the notation used for the ticks on the x-axis follows the pattern ``<scaling_algorithm>_<number of iterations>_<include_rhs>``.
For example, ``geom_3_rhs`` indicates the geometric mean scaling algorithm with three iterations and including the right-hand side vector for deriving the row scaling vector.
A combination of ``geom`` and ``infnorm``, where geometric mean scaling is followed by infinity norm scaling, is indicated by ``geom_infnorm``.

1. ``PI_small``

.. image:: images/PI_small_net_solving_time_plot.png
    :alt: Net-solving time comparison for PI_small

Note that the ``Base Case`` refers to a configuration where Gurobi scaling with a ``NumericFocus`` of ``0`` is applied, but no scaling in ZEN-garden. Since for this model all scaling configurations that use ZEN-garden are run with a fixed ``NumericFocus`` of ``1`` (corresponding to low numeric focus)
, we also included a ``Base Case`` configuration with a ``NumericFocus`` of ``1`` for comparison. The red dotted line indicates the arithmetic mean of the net-solving time for the base case configuration.
Red dots represent the solving time without the time spent on scaling the problem, whereas the blue dots represent the net-solving time that includes both.

The plot shows:

* a significant decrease in net-solving time for the model ``PI_small`` for a majority of the considered algorithms when ZEN-garden scaling is applied
* on average configurations that include the right-hand side vector for deriving the row scaling vector indicate a better performance
* solving times are very inconsistent leading to large variances in the net-solving time for each scaling algorithm
* scaling time only makes up a small fraction of the net-solving time

2. ``NoErr``

.. image:: images/NoErr_errorbar_plot.png
    :alt: Net-solving time comparison for NoErr

In the analysis of the model ``NoErr`` we set special focus on the interaction and compatibility of ZEN-garden scaling with the numeric settings of Gurobi. For this we
included for each algorithm four configurations with different combinations of ZEN-garden scaling and Gurobi's ``ScaleFlag`` and ``NumericFocus``. A ``ScaleFlag`` of ``2`` indicates that Gurobi scaling is turned on
and thus double scaling (ZEN-garden and Gurobi) is applied. A ``NumericFocus`` of ``0`` indicates an automatic numeric focus, whereas a ``NumericFocus`` of ``3`` indicates high numeric focus. Again, the base cases correspond to no ZEN-garden scaling.

From the plot we can derive:

* a configuration where no scaling is applied (neither ZEN-garden nor Gurobi) can also lead to the best performance (as indicated by ``Base Case (No Scaling)``)
* double scaling (ZEN-garden and Gurobi scaling) does not seem to be beneficial and rather increases the net-solving time
* setting a high numeric focus increases the net-solving time significantly for all scaling configurations
* only for a very few algorithms net-solving time is decreased when ZEN-garden scaling is applied and only for an automatic numeric focus and no Gurobi scaling

The two examples shown here, again indicate that deriving a general recommendation for the scaling configuration is difficult and that the performance of the scaling algorithm is highly dependent on the optimization problem at hand.
Therefore, we recommended to test different scaling algorithms and configurations via trial and error.

Regression Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Based on the collected data from the benchmarking runs for the models ``PI_small``, ``WES_nofe``, ``WES_nofe_PI``, and ``WES_nofe_PC``, a regression is run with the net-solving time (solving time + scaling time) as
the dependent variable. The explanatory variables are the models, the ``use_scaling`` boolean, the ``include_rhs`` boolean, the ``NumericFcous`` (:math:`0` or :math:`1`) setting of Gurobi as well as an interaction term between ZEN-garden scaling and Gurobi's ``ScaleFlag``.
The results of the regression analysis are the following:

The key takeaways from the regression analysis are:

* including ZEN-garden scaling decreases the net-solving time significantly
* including the RHS for the derivation of the row scaling vectors decreases the net-solving time significantly
* choosing a low ``NumericFocus`` instead of the automatic one, increases the net-solving time significantly
* double scaling, which means scaling both in ZEN-garden as well as within the solver (here Gurobi), seems to increase the net-solving time significantly

Please note, that these results can not be generalized. They only represent the average effect observed for the models considered here and might vary from case to case.
