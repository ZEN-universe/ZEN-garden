Tutorial 6: Unit consistency
############################

Our models describe physical processes, where every numerical value is associated
to a physical unit. For example, the capacity of a coal power plant is a power,
thus the unit is, e.g., GW. In our optimization models, we use a large variety
of different technologies and carriers, for which the input data is often
provided in different units. The optimization problem itself however only
accepts numeric values.

Thus, we have to make sure that the numeric values have the same physical base 
unit, i.e., if our input data for technology A is in GW and for technology B in 
MW, we want to convert both numeric values to, e.g., GW. Another reason for 
using a base unit is to `keep the numerics of the optimization model in check 
<https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.5/refman/guidelines_for_numerical_i.html>`_.


Convert units to common base units
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We define a set of base units, which we can combine to represent each 
dimensionality in our model. Each unit has a certain physical dimensionality:

.. code-block::

    km => [distance]
    hour => [time]
    Euro => [currency]
    GW => [mass]^1 [length]^2 [time]^-3

We make use of the fact, that we can combine the base units to any unit by 
comparing the dimensionalities. For example, Euro/MWh can be converted to:

.. code-block::

    Euro/MWh
    => [currency]^1 [mass]^-1 [length]^-2 [time]^2
    = [currency]^1 [[mass]^1 [length]^2 [time]^-3]^-1 [time]^-1
    => Euro/GW/hour

We convert the units by calculating the multiplier

.. code-block::

    (Euro/GW/hour)/(Euro/MWh) = (MW)/(GW) = 0.001

and multiplying the numeric value with the multiplier.

The base units are defined in the input data set in the file 
``/energy_system/base_units.csv``. You have to provide an input unit for all 
attributes in the input files. The unit is added as the ``unit`` field after 
the default value in the ``attributes.json`` file (:ref:`input_structure.attribute_files`).


Defining new units
------------------

We are using the package `pint <https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, which 
already has the most common units defined. However, some exotic ones, such as 
``Euro``, are not yet defined. You can add new units in the file 
``system_specification/unit_definitions.txt``:

.. code-block::

    Euro = [currency] = EURO = Eur
    pkm = [mileage] = passenger_km = passenger_kilometer

Here, we make use of the existing dimensionality ``[currency]``. If there is a 
unit you want to define with a dimensionality that does not exist yet, you can 
define it the same way: ``pkm = [mileage]``. The unit ``pkm`` now has the 
dimensionality ``[mileage]``.

**What do I have to look out for?**

There are a few rules to follow in choosing the base units:

1. The base units must be exhaustive, thus all input units must be represented 
   as a combination of the base units (i.e., ``Euro/MWh => Euro/GW/hour``). Each 
   base unit can only be raised to the power 1, -1, or 0. We do not want to $
   represent a unit by any base unit with a different exponent, e.g., 
   ``km => (m^3)^(1/3)``
2. The base units themselves can not be linearly dependent, e.g., you cannot 
   choose the base units ``GW``, ``hour`` and ``GJ``.
3. The dimensionalities must be unique. While you can use ``m^3`` and ``km``, 
   you cannot use both ``MW`` and ``GW``. You will get a warning if you define 
   the same unit twice.


Enforcing unit consistency
--------------------------

Converting all numeric values to the same set of base units enforces that all 
magnitudes are comparable; however, this does not ensure that the units are 
consistent across parameters and elements (technologies and carriers). For 
example, a user might have defined the capacity of an electrolyzer in ``GW``, 
but the investment costs in ``Euro/(ton/hour)``.

To enforce unit consistency, ZEN-garden checks the units of all parameters and 
elements and throws an error if the units are not consistent. In particular, 
ZEN-garden connects technologies to their reference carriers and checks if the 
units of the reference carriers are consistent with the units of the technology 
parameters. If any inconsistency is found, ZEN-garden tries to guess the 
inconsistent unit (the least common unit) and displays it in the error message.

After ensuring unit consistency, ZEN-garden implies the units of all variables 
in the optimization problem based on the units of the parameters. Each variable 
definition (``variable.add_variable()``) has the argument ``unit_category`` that 
defines the combination of units and can look like 
``unit_category={"energy_quantity": 1, "time": -1}``.

.. note::

    In the results (:ref:`t_analyze.results_code`), you can retrieve the unit of all 
    parameters and variables by calling 
    ``r.get_unit(<variable/parameter name>)``, where ``r`` is a results object.


Known issues with pint
--------------------------------

The ``pint`` package that we use for the unit handling has amazing 
functionalities but also some hurdles to look out for. The ones we have already 
found are:

* ``ton``: pint uses the keyword ``ton`` for imperial ton, not the metric ton. 
  The keyword for those are ``metric_ton`` or ``tonne``. However, per default, 
  ZEN-garden overwrites the definition of ``ton`` to be the metric ton, so 
  ``ton`` and ``tonne`` can be used interchangeably. If you for some reason 
  want to use imperial tons, set ``"solver": 
  {"define_ton_as_metric_ton": false}``.

* ``h``: Until recently, ``h`` was treated as the planck constant, not hour. 
  Fortunately, this has been fixed in Feb 2023. If you encounter this error, 
  please update your pint version.
