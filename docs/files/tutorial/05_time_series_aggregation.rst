Time steps in ZEN-garden
------------------------

ZEN-garden is a temporally resolved investment and operation optimization model. 
That means that in general we have three different time indices:

1. ``set_base_time_steps``: is the highest resolution in the model. It is not 
   necessarily used to index any component, but merely as a common "beat" or 
   "rhythm" to all other time indices. We consider each hour as the base time 
   index. Thus, each time index can be converted to the base time index, which 
   is then a sequence of the time steps with the length of the base time index. 
   This sequence is called ``sequence_time_steps``. The number of occurrences of 
   each time step is called ``time_steps_duration``.
2. ``set_time_steps_yearly``: Some components have a yearly resolution. These 
   include for example the yearly carbon emission limit 
   (``carbon_emissions_limit``) or the yearly costs (``cost_total``). Note that 
   these are in general not associated with any specific element (technology or 
   carrier).
3. ``set_time_steps_operation``: The operation of built capacities is resolved 
   on a higher resolution than the yearly time steps. For the technologies and 
   the carriers, this is the index ``set_time_steps_operation``.

The time parameters in ZEN-garden
---------------------------------

* ``reference_year``: First year of the optimization. Used to calculate the 
  remaining lifetime of the existing capacities and the following years of the 
  optimization.
* ``unaggregated_time_steps_per_year``: number of base time steps per 
  optimization year. Must be <= 8760 (total number of hours per year)
* ``aggregated_time_steps_per_year``: number of representative periods per year 
  to aggregate the time series. Thus, all operational components are aggregated 
  to ``aggregated_time_steps_per_year`` time steps. For further information on 
  time series aggregation, see below.
* ``optimized_years``: number of investigated years.
* ``interval_between_years``: interval between two optimization years.
* ``use_rolling_horizon``: if True, we do not optimize all years simultaneously 
  but optimize for a subset of years and afterward move the optimization window 
  to the next year and optimize again. For further information on rolling $
  horizon and myopic foresight versus perfect foresight refer to, e.g., 
  `Poncelet et al. 2016 <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261915013276>`_.
* ``years_in_rolling_horizon``: number of optimization periods in the subset of 
  the optimization horizon as mentioned above. Only relevant if 
  ``use_rolling_horizon`` is True.
* ``interval_between_optimizations``: number of optimization periods for which 
  the decisions of each rolling horizon are saved. Must be shorter than 
  ``years_in_rolling_horizon``; default is 1. For an example for varying 
  decision horizon lengths, refer to `Keppo et al. 2010 
  <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544210000216>`_. 
  Only relevant if ``use_rolling_horizon`` is True.

Example I, no rolling horizon:

.. code-block::

    "reference_year": 2020,
    "optimized_years": 4,
    "interval_between_years": 10

The resulting investigated years are

.. code-block::

    [2020,2030,2040,2050]

Example II, rolling horizon:

.. code-block::

    "reference_year": 2020,
    "optimized_years": 4,
    "interval_between_years": 10,
    "use_rolling_horizon": True,
    "years_in_rolling_horizon": 2,
    "interval_between_optimizations": 1

The resulting sequence of investigated years are:

.. code-block::

    [2020,2030]
    [2030,2040]
    [2040,2050]
    [2050]


What is the idea of time series aggregation?
---------------------------------------------------

Full time series with 8760 time steps per year are often too large so that the 
optimization takes too long or cannot be solved at all in feasible times.
Thus, we apply a time series aggregation (TSA) which reduces the number of time 
steps by aggregating time steps with similar input values to a single time step.
By doing so, we can represent our full time series (8760 base time steps) by 
representative time steps, e.g., 200.


Disabling the time series aggregation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open the ``system.json`` file and set ``"conduct_time_series_aggregation"=False``. 
This disables the time series aggregation. If you do not want to investigate a 
full year, set ``"unaggregated_time_steps_per_year"<8760``


.. _t_tsa.using_the_tsa:

Using time series aggregation
-------------------------------------------------------

Open the ``system.json`` file and set ``"aggregated_time_steps_per_year"`` 
smaller than ``"unaggregated_time_steps_per_year"``. You are then aggregating 
``"unaggregated_time_steps_per_year"`` (e.g., 8760 base time steps) to 
``"aggregated_time_steps_per_year"`` (e.g., 200 representative time steps). If
you mistakingly set 
``"aggregated_time_steps_per_year">"unaggregated_time_steps_per_year"``, 
don't worry, the TSA is disabled and it behaves as if 
``"aggregated_time_steps_per_year"="unaggregated_time_steps_per_year"``.

Additionally, you can exclude parameters for specific elements from the 
clustering process. This is useful if you have time series that should not 
influence the clustering process. This could, for example, a helper time series 
to artificially decrease the capacity factor of a technology. To exclude 
parameters from the TSA, create a csv file named 
``exclude_parameter_from_TSA.csv`` in the ``energy_system`` folder. In this 
file, you can specify the elements and parameters that should be excluded from 
the TSA. For example, you can exclude the parameter ``availability_import`` for 
the element ``natural_gas`` by adding the following line to the 
``exclude_parameter_from_TSA.csv`` file:

.. code-block::

    element,parameter
    natural_gas,availability_import

If you want to exclude the parameter of all elements of a class, e.g., 
``set_technologies``, you can use the class name as the element. For example, to 
exclude the parameter ``max_load`` for all technologies, add the following line 
to the ``exclude_parameter_from_TSA.csv`` file:

.. code-block::

    element,parameter
    set_technologies,max_load

Furthermore, you can exclude all parameters for a specific element by setting 
the parameter to ``nan``. For example, to exclude all parameters for the element 
``natural_gas_boiler``, add the following line to the 
``exclude_parameter_from_TSA.csv`` file:

.. code-block::

    element,parameter
    natural_gas_boiler,nan

For an in-depth introduction to TSA, refer to `Hoffmann et al. 2020 
<https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/3/641>`_. The authors at FZ JÃ¼lich are also 
the developers of the TSA package `tsam 
<https://tsam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ that we are using in ZEN-garden.


Modeling short- and long-term storages?
--------------------------------------------------

The modeling of storage technologies with TSA is challenging because storages 
couple time steps (see :ref:`input_structure.storage_technologies`). Hence, the sequence of 
time steps is important for the operation of the storage level. There are 
different approaches to model storages with TSA, with the approaches by 
`Gabrielli et al. 2018 <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261917310139>`_ 
and `Kotzur et al. <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261918300242>`_ 
being the most common. In ZEN-garden, we extend the approach by Gabrielli et al. 
2018 to model storages with TSA. The approach is detailed in `Mannhardt et al. 
2023 <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004223008271>`_. In 
short, every time that the sequence of operational time steps changes, the 
another storage time step is added. This increases the number of variables, but 
explicitly enables short- and long-term storages. In particular, this 
storage level representation leads to fewer time steps than the full time series 
without loss of information.


Additional information
----------------------------------------------------

1. In the ``default_config.py``, you find the class ``TimeSeriesAggregation`` 
   where you can set the ``clusterMethod``, ``solver``, ``extremePeriodMethod`` 
   and ``representationMethod``. Most importantly, the ``clusterMethod`` selects 
   which algorithm is used to determine the clusters of representative time 
   steps. Probably, the most common ones are `k_means 
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering>`_ and `k_medoids 
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medoids>`_. While it is probably not 
   necessary at this point to understand the difference of k-means and k-medoids 
   in detail, it is important to know that k-means averages the input data over 
   the representative time steps, which reduces the extreme period behavior, 
   thus, peaks are smoothened.
2. As said before, each aggregated time step represents multiple base time 
   steps. Thus, the behavior in each aggregated time step accounts for more than 
   one time step. Thus, the operational costs and operational carbon emissions 
   of each aggregated time step are multiplied with the 
   ``time_steps_operation_duration`` of the respective time step.
3. What is this strange ``sequence_time_steps`` floating around everywhere in 
   the code? The substitution of the base time steps by the aggregated time 
   steps yields a sequence of time steps, which is ``len(set_base_time_steps)`` 
   entries long and encapsulates the order in which the aggregated time steps 
   appear in the representation of the base time steps. We use the sequence of 
   time steps to convert one time step into another. For example we can use the 
   order to get the yearly time step associated with a certain operational time 
   step, or the year of a certain operational time step.
